# Introduction
Under a binary treatment setting in which the treatment is not randomly assigned, it is well known that comparing mean outcomes across the control and treatment group indicates a correlation rather than a causal effect. However if we control for the selection into the two groups by using pre-treatment covariates, causal parameters can still be identified. 

The note "Selection on Observables.pdf" discusses several stragtegies for meeting identification requirements using observed pre-treatment covariates.
